 ### TSA-API Setup
 * To test locally:
 * Setup your environment variables (all described in server.js)
 * navigate to local repo  and run "npm i" then "node server.js" - navigate to your localhost:[port] which is set by your env variable
 
 ### WARNING - On First run, the TXI library fulltext index is going to run on the airports-meta.json file
 ### THIS WILL TAKE 3-5 MINUTES - a 0.....50.....100 will be displayed in console
 ### Once the index completes, you can open up server.js and comment out line 41 loadDatabase() - the index will persist locally and will no longer run each time you execute "node server.js" 
 * we are working on finding a better library to work with PouchDB with better performance as well as a better way to manage the index that is scalable (and not a comment toggle..lol) - any suggestions please pass them across :)
